### Blockers/Concerns

From codebase analysis (see .planning/codebase/CONCERNS.md):
- Biased shuffle algorithm affects test fairness (FNDN-01 will fix)
- Race condition in test save causes duplicate records (FNDN-02 will fix)
- history.pushState memory leak during tests (FNDN-03 will fix)
- React Router + Next.js causes 404 on refresh (PWA-02 will address)
- iOS Safari 7-day data eviction (PWA-11 will mitigate)
