## Position

**Milestone:** v3.0 World-Class UX
**Current phase:** 37-bug-fixes-ux-polish
**Current Plan:** Not started
**Status:** Milestone complete

## Accumulated Context

### Roadmap Evolution
- Phase 37 added: Bug Fixes & UX Polish (Study Guide, Flashcards, Review Deck, Mock Test, Interview fixes + About navbar link)

### Decisions
- 37-03: Local-only persistence (no Supabase sync) for bookmark simplicity
- 37-03: Dedicated IndexedDB store matching srsStore pattern
- 37-03: Simple hook pattern (no Context provider) since bookmark state is component-local
- 37-02: Heart icon placed between language toggle and theme toggle in both nav surfaces
- 37-02: Used fill-current class for filled heart active state instead of separate filled icon
- 37-02: CSS-based float+shimmer for About card instead of JS-only animation for performance
- [Phase 37]: Card idle/hover variants must explicitly set opacity:1 and scale:1 when initial includes opacity:0/scale:0.95
- [Phase 37]: handleSelfGrade triggers feedback phase to reuse FEEDBACK effect for answer display
- [Phase 37]: InterviewTranscript gates answer reveal on mode === 'practice' to hide answers in realistic mode
- 37-04: Navigate to category flashcard view (#cards-{category}) not specific question since hash routing already supports it
- 37-04: Normalized FSRS difficulty (1-10) to 0-1 for 5-dot visual indicator
- 37-04: Session-scoped banner dismiss resets on reload as designed
- 37-05: Short category labels in chips (Democracy, Government, etc.) to prevent overflow
- 37-05: useMemo-based stable setter for FlashcardStack controlled mode to satisfy React Compiler
- 37-05: shuffleKey counter triggers Fisher-Yates re-shuffle via useMemo dependency
- 37-07: TTS engine verified clean - all 6 browser quirk workarounds properly implemented
- 37-07: Sync architecture verified clean - last-write-wins merge, exponential backoff, auto-sync on reconnect
- 37-07: FSRS verified clean - isDue uses UTC Date comparison, gradeCard maps Easy->Good/Hard->Again correctly
- 37-07: Toast Burmese text uses text-white/80 not text-muted-foreground on colored backgrounds
- 37-06: Bookmark state passed via props not hooks inside Flashcard3D for decoupling
- 37-06: Difficulty derived from question number (1-40 Beginner, 41-80 Intermediate, 81+ Advanced)
- 37-06: FSRS State.Review mapped to Mastered label (high retention = mastered)
- 37-06: Auto-play uses isolated TTS engine + disables auto-read to prevent audio overlap
- 37-06: controlledFlipped prop enables external flip control for auto-play
