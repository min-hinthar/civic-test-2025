<objective>
Write all 28 missing explanation objects for the USCIS 2025 addition questions, matching the existing explanation style with bilingual English/Burmese content.

Purpose: Fills the known data gap so the "Why?" explanation section renders for all 128 questions, and Burmese audio generation (later plan) has explanation text to synthesize.
Output: 28 complete explanation objects in uscis-2025-additions.ts.

  <name>Task 1: Write explanations for USCIS 2025 questions GOV-P13 through GOV-S19</name>
  <files>src/constants/questions/uscis-2025-additions.ts</files>
  <action>
Add `explanation` objects to the first 14 questions in uscis-2025-additions.ts (GOV-P13 through GOV-S19, the government and system questions).

For EACH question, add an `explanation` property after the `answers` array with:
- `brief_en`: 2-3 sentences explaining WHY the answer is correct, not restating the answer. Include historical context or constitutional basis where relevant. Match the style of existing explanations in american-government.ts.
- `brief_my`: Natural Burmese phrasing of the same explanation. NOT a word-for-word translation. Write as if explaining to a Burmese speaker learning about US government.

Optional fields (include where genuinely helpful):
- `citation`: Constitutional article, amendment, or landmark event reference
- `commonMistake_en` / `commonMistake_my`: Why the most common wrong answer is wrong
- `relatedQuestionIds`: IDs of related questions in the existing bank

**Style guide from existing explanations:**
- English: Direct, factual, 2-3 sentences. Start with the key concept, then add context.
- Burmese: Natural Myanmar phrasing. Use formal-but-accessible register. Include English terms in parentheses for key constitutional concepts.
- Avoid starting every explanation with "The" or repeating the question.

**Example from GOV-P01:**
```
explanation: {
  brief_en: 'The Constitution is the highest legal authority in the United States. All other laws must follow it, and no person or government body is above it.',
  brief_my: 'ဖွဲ့စည်းပုံအခြေခံဥပဒေသည် အမေရိကန်ပြည်ထောင်စု၏ အမြင့်ဆုံးဥပဒေဖြစ်ပါသည်...',
  citation: 'Article VI, Clause 2 (Supremacy Clause)',
}
```

Ensure each explanation is factually accurate for the USCIS civics test context. The 14 questions cover: popular sovereignty, Bill of Rights purpose, consent of the governed, amendment process, Electoral College, habeas corpus, inalienable rights, Article I/II/III functions, federal system, executive orders, judicial independence, tribal sovereignty, amendment definitions, and state powers.

`npx tsc --noEmit` passes.
`npx eslint src/constants/questions/uscis-2025-additions.ts` passes.
Verify: every question object in the first half of the file has an `explanation` property.
  </verify>
  <done>
First 14 USCIS 2025 questions have complete explanation objects with brief_en and brief_my. Style matches existing explanations.
  </done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Write explanations for USCIS 2025 questions HIST through RR</name>
  <files>src/constants/questions/uscis-2025-additions.ts</files>
  <action>
Add `explanation` objects to the remaining 14 questions in uscis-2025-additions.ts (history and rights/responsibilities questions).

Follow the same style guide and quality standards as Task 1. These questions cover topics like:
- Historical events (Trail of Tears, women's suffrage, Cold War, 9/11, etc.)
- Rights and civic duties (petition right, civic participation, immigrant contributions, etc.)
- Symbols and geography

For history questions, include relevant dates and historical context. For rights questions, reference the specific amendment or constitutional provision.

Same format requirements:
- `brief_en`: 2-3 factual sentences, why-not-what style
- `brief_my`: Natural Burmese phrasing with English terms in parentheses for key concepts
- Optional: `citation`, `commonMistake_en/my`, `relatedQuestionIds`

After adding all 28 explanations, verify the file has exactly 28 question objects and each has an `explanation` property.

`npx tsc --noEmit` passes.
`npx eslint src/constants/questions/uscis-2025-additions.ts` passes.
Run: `grep -c "explanation:" src/constants/questions/uscis-2025-additions.ts` -- should output 28.
`npm run build` succeeds.
  </verify>
  <done>
All 28 USCIS 2025 questions have complete explanation objects. Zero questions in the file lack explanations. File compiles and lints clean.
