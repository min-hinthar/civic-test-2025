<objective>
Build verification and visual/functional checkpoint for the complete Phase 17 UI System Polish.

Purpose: Verify all four UISYS requirements (02-05) are satisfied and the app feels premium and iOS-inspired.
Output: Verification report confirming all success criteria.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Automated build and code verification</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
  Run comprehensive automated checks:

  1. **Build check:** `npx next build` -- must pass with zero errors
  2. **Type check:** `npx tsc --noEmit` -- must pass with zero errors
  3. **Lint check:** `npx eslint src/ --max-warnings 0` (or whatever the project lint command is)
  4. **Test check:** `npm test` -- all existing tests must still pass

  **UISYS-02 verification (glass-morphism):**
  - Grep for `glass-heavy` in navigation components (Sidebar.tsx, BottomTabBar.tsx) -- must find matches
  - Grep for `glass-medium` in GlassHeader.tsx -- must find match
  - Grep for `prismatic-border` in navigation components -- must find matches
  - Verify `prismatic-border.css` exists and contains `@property --prismatic-angle`

  **UISYS-03 verification (touch targets):**
  - Grep for `min-h-\[44px\]` or `min-h-\[48px\]` or `min-h-\[52px\]` or `min-h-\[56px\]` across key components
  - Verify Button.tsx has `min-h-[44px]` for md size
  - Verify icon-only buttons (ThemeToggle, SpeechButton, etc.) have `h-12 w-12` (48px)

  **UISYS-04 verification (micro-interactions):**
  - Grep for `SPRING_BOUNCY` imports across components -- should find in Button, StaggeredList, AnswerFeedback, etc.
  - Verify motion-config.ts exists and exports spring configs
  - Verify StaggeredList.tsx uses SPRING_BOUNCY with visible overshoot (damping: 15)
  - Verify PageTransition.tsx has scale property in exit variants

  **UISYS-05 verification (dark mode):**
  - Verify tokens.css `.dark` has `--color-surface-elevated-*` tokens
  - Verify globals.css dark glass variants have purple tint (`accent-purple`)
  - Verify ThemeContext.tsx contains `startViewTransition`
  - Verify dark mesh gradient uses deep purple + magenta

  Create verification report at `.planning/phases/17-ui-system-polish/17-10-VERIFICATION.md` with pass/fail for each check.

  <verify>All automated checks pass. Verification report created with all items passing.</verify>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Complete Phase 17 UI System Polish: glass-morphism on all surfaces, animated prismatic borders, bouncy micro-interactions, 44px+ touch targets, circular reveal theme toggle, and refined dark mode with frosted glass.</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
  Start the dev server (`npm run dev`) and verify in the browser:

  **UISYS-02: Glass-morphism**
  1. Desktop: Sidebar shows frosted glass with animated rainbow border on edges
  2. Mobile (resize to <768px): Bottom tab bar shows frosted glass with rainbow border
  3. Cards on Dashboard, Hub pages show glass effect with visible background blur
  4. Switch to dark mode: glass surfaces have a subtle purple tint

  **UISYS-03: Touch targets**
  5. In Chrome DevTools mobile mode (iPhone 14): all buttons, tabs, form inputs are easily tappable
  6. Study guide question rows are full-width tappable cards
  7. Icon-only buttons (theme toggle, language toggle) are at least 48px

  **UISYS-04: Micro-interactions**
  8. Click any primary button: see it scale down to 95% with glow and bounce back
  9. Switch Hub tabs: active indicator slides with spring bounce
  10. Navigate between pages: outgoing page scales down, incoming slides in
  11. Flip a flashcard: spring bounce with slight overshoot past 180 degrees
  12. Answer a test question: correct = green flash + bouncing check, incorrect = red flash + shaking X

  **UISYS-05: Dark mode**
  13. Toggle to dark mode: circular reveal animation (dark expands from click point)
  14. Toggle to light mode: circular dissolve animation (light collapses to click point)
  15. Dark mode surfaces have frosted glass with visible purple tint
  16. Dark mode prismatic borders are brighter/neon compared to light mode
  17. Dashboard and Hub look visually distinct in dark mode (not just inverted)
