<objective>
Expand the question bank from 120 to 128 questions and add dynamic answer metadata.

Purpose: Satisfies USCIS-01 (128 bilingual questions), USCIS-02 (correct category structure), USCIS-03 (dynamic answer marking), and partially USCIS-05 (128Q total auto-propagates via allQuestions.length).

Output: Extended Question type with `dynamic` field, 8 new questions in uscis-2025-additions.ts, dynamic metadata on 9 existing questions in american-government.ts, and updated barrel file comments.

  <name>Task 1: Extend Question type and add 8 missing questions with dynamic metadata</name>

**Step 1: Extend Question type in `src/types/index.ts`**

Add `DynamicAnswerMeta` interface and optional `dynamic` field to the `Question` interface:

```typescript
export interface DynamicAnswerMeta {
  /** 'time' = changes with elections/appointments; 'state' = varies by user's location */
  type: 'time' | 'state';
  /** Semantic field name, e.g. 'president', 'senators', 'governor', 'capital' */
  field: string;
  /** ISO date when this answer was last verified, e.g. '2026-02-09' */
  lastVerified: string;
  /** Human-readable trigger for when to update, e.g. 'presidential election (every 4 years)' */
  updateTrigger: string;
}
```

Add to `Question` interface:
```typescript
  /** Marks questions whose answers change over time or vary by location */
  dynamic?: DynamicAnswerMeta;
```

**Step 2: Add 8 missing questions to `src/constants/questions/uscis-2025-additions.ts`**

Append these 8 questions to the existing `uscis2025Additions` array. Each must have:
- Full bilingual content (question_en, question_my)
- `studyAnswers` array with all acceptable answers (some questions have multiple valid answers)
- `answers` array with 1 correct + 3 plausible-but-wrong distractors
- Correct `category` matching the TypeScript `Category` type exactly
- IDs continuing the existing sequence

The 8 missing questions (from research -- verify exact wording against USCIS 2025 128Q PDF):

1. **GOV-P17** - "Many documents influenced the United States Constitution. Name one."
   - Category: `'Principles of American Democracy'`
   - Study answers: Magna Carta, Articles of Confederation, Federalist Papers, Anti-Federalist Papers, Declaration of Independence, English Bill of Rights
   - The quiz correct answer should be one of these (pick "Magna Carta" for the quiz). Distractors: Treaty of Paris, Monroe Doctrine, Gettysburg Address

2. **GOV-S40** - "Why do U.S. representatives serve shorter terms than U.S. senators?"
   - Category: `'System of Government'`
   - Study answers: To more closely follow public opinion, to be more responsive to the people
   - Distractors: Because they have less power, Because the Constitution was amended, Because they represent fewer people

3. **GOV-S41** - "How many senators does each state have?"
   - Category: `'System of Government'`
   - Study answer: Two (2)
   - Distractors: One (1), Four (4), It depends on the state's population

4. **GOV-S42** - "Why does each state have two senators?"
   - Category: `'System of Government'`
   - Study answers: Equal representation for small and large states, so all states have equal power in the Senate
   - Distractors: Because it was George Washington's idea, Because there are two parties, Because senators serve two terms

5. **GOV-S43** - "The President of the United States can serve only two terms. Why?"
   - Category: `'System of Government'`
   - Study answers: Because of the 22nd Amendment, to prevent abuse of power, to ensure peaceful transfer of power
   - Distractors: Because of the Bill of Rights, Because of the Supreme Court, Because Congress limits it

6. **GOV-S44** - "Why is the Electoral College important?"
   - Category: `'System of Government'`
   - Study answers: It decides who is elected president, it provides a compromise between the popular vote and congressional vote
   - Distractors: It trains future politicians, It sets the budget, It approves new laws

7. **GOV-S45** - "How long do Supreme Court justices serve?"
   - Category: `'System of Government'`
   - Study answers: They are appointed for life, until they want to retire, until they die, until they are impeached and convicted
   - Distractors: 20 years, 10 years, Until the next president takes office

8. **GOV-S46** - "Why do Supreme Court justices serve for life?"
   - Category: `'System of Government'`
   - Study answers: To be independent from politics, so they can make decisions based on the Constitution rather than popular opinion
   - Distractors: Because they are elected by the people, Because the President decides, Because Congress cannot remove them

All Burmese translations must follow existing codebase style: natural Burmese rephrasing, NOT word-for-word translation. Reference existing question patterns in `uscis-2025-additions.ts` for style consistency.

Update the file header comment from "20 additions" and "extend to 120" to "28 additions" and "extend to 128".

**Step 3: Add dynamic metadata AND code comments to 9 existing questions in `src/constants/questions/american-government.ts`**

Add `dynamic` field to these 9 question objects. Per locked decision from CONTEXT.md, ALSO add a code comment above each dynamic question explaining what to update and when.

Time-dynamic questions (answers change with elections/appointments):
- `GOV-S16` (President): `{ type: 'time', field: 'president', lastVerified: '2026-02-09', updateTrigger: 'Presidential election (every 4 years)' }`
  - Code comment: `// DYNAMIC: Update answer after presidential elections (every 4 years). Next check: Nov 2028.`
- `GOV-S17` (Vice President): `{ type: 'time', field: 'vicePresident', lastVerified: '2026-02-09', updateTrigger: 'Presidential election (every 4 years)' }`
  - Code comment: `// DYNAMIC: Update answer after presidential elections (every 4 years). Next check: Nov 2028.`
- `GOV-S28` (Chief Justice): `{ type: 'time', field: 'chiefJustice', lastVerified: '2026-02-09', updateTrigger: 'Supreme Court appointment (lifetime tenure, changes on retirement/death)' }`
  - Code comment: `// DYNAMIC: Update on Chief Justice retirement/death/impeachment. No fixed schedule — monitor news.`
- `GOV-S34` (President's party): `{ type: 'time', field: 'presidentParty', lastVerified: '2026-02-09', updateTrigger: 'Presidential election (every 4 years)' }`
  - Code comment: `// DYNAMIC: Update after presidential elections (every 4 years). Next check: Nov 2028.`
- `GOV-S35` (Speaker of the House): `{ type: 'time', field: 'speakerOfHouse', lastVerified: '2026-02-09', updateTrigger: 'Each new Congress (every 2 years) or vacancy' }`
  - Code comment: `// DYNAMIC: Update each new Congress (every 2 years) or on vacancy. Next check: Jan 2027.`

State-specific questions (answers vary by user's location):
- `GOV-S08` (State's U.S. Senators): `{ type: 'state', field: 'senators', lastVerified: '2026-02-09', updateTrigger: 'Senate elections (staggered 6-year terms)' }`
  - Code comment: `// DYNAMIC(state): Senators vary by state. Update state-representatives.json after Senate elections.`
- `GOV-S11` (U.S. Representative): `{ type: 'state', field: 'representative', lastVerified: '2026-02-09', updateTrigger: 'House elections (every 2 years)' }`
  - Code comment: `// DYNAMIC(state): Representatives vary by district. Update state-representatives.json after House elections (every 2 years).`
- `GOV-S31` (Governor): `{ type: 'state', field: 'governor', lastVerified: '2026-02-09', updateTrigger: 'State gubernatorial elections (varies by state)' }`
  - Code comment: `// DYNAMIC(state): Governor varies by state. Update state-representatives.json after gubernatorial elections.`
- `GOV-S32` (State capital): `{ type: 'state', field: 'capital', lastVerified: '2026-02-09', updateTrigger: 'Static - state capitals do not change' }`
  - Code comment: `// DYNAMIC(state): Capital varies by state but is effectively static. No regular updates needed.`

Add import of `DynamicAnswerMeta` to american-government.ts if the type is used explicitly (or rely on inference from the Question type).

**Step 4: Update barrel file comments in `src/constants/questions/index.ts`**

Update the header comment to reflect new counts:
- GOV-P## : 17 questions (was 16)
- GOV-S## : 46 questions (was 39)
- Total: 128 questions (was 120)

Update inline comments on array spread lines:
- `americanGovernmentQuestions` comment: `(47 questions)` stays same (these are the base file)
- `uscis2025Additions` comment: update to `28 questions` (was 20)
