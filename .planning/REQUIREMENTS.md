## v2 Requirements

Deferred from v1. Use `/gsd:new-milestone` to scope and prioritize.

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Native mobile app (Capacitor/RN) | PWA is sufficient |
| Real-time chat | High complexity, not core to test prep |
| Video content | Storage/bandwidth costs, unnecessary for civics format |
| AI chatbot tutor | Expensive API costs, risk of incorrect answers |
| Paid/premium tier | App stays free for immigrants |
| Full voice input recognition | Complex, privacy concerns |
