  <what-built>Complete USCIS 2025 question bank update with 128 questions, dynamic answer handling, state personalization, and update indicators</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. **Start dev server**: `npm run dev`, navigate to http://localhost:3000

2. **Dashboard check**: Log in and verify:
   - "Updated for USCIS 2025 Civics Test — 128 Questions" banner is visible at the top
   - Banner has both English and Burmese text

3. **Study Guide check**: Go to /study:
   - Update banner visible
   - Browse all categories -- verify questions are grouped correctly
   - Count total questions across all categories (should show 128 or include "128" in the UI somewhere)
   - Find a dynamic question (e.g., "What is the name of the President?" GOV-S16):
     - Flip the card -- verify "Answer may change with elections" note appears with a last-verified date

4. **State personalization**: Go to /settings:
   - Find the "Location" section with state picker
   - Select your state (e.g., California)
   - Go back to study guide
   - Find "Who is the Governor of your state?" question
   - Verify it shows your state's governor name

5. **Mock test**: Go to /test:
   - Verify update banner on pre-test screen
   - Start a test -- verify 20 questions drawn (may include new questions from the expanded bank)
   - If a dynamic question appears, verify the note is shown after answering

6. **Interview sim**: Go to /interview:
   - Verify update banner on pre-interview screen

7. **What's New modal** (test for returning users):
   - Clear localStorage key `civic-prep-whats-new-2025-seen` in DevTools
   - Reload the page
   - Verify the What's New modal appears with 3 features highlighted
   - Dismiss it and reload -- verify it does not appear again

8. **Mastery normalization check**: With existing study data in localStorage:
   - Check the Dashboard readiness indicator -- it should show mastery as X/128 (not X/120)
   - The "Questions practiced" counter should show "X / 128"
   - If you previously had e.g. 60/120 (50%) mastery, it should now show roughly 60/128 (~47%) -- a small natural dip from the 8 new unscored questions, not an artificial drop
   - Navigate to the study guide category view and verify category counts add up to 128
   - Confirm no user sees a mastery score HIGHER than before (which would indicate a normalization bug)
   - Per locked decision: mastery dips naturally and self-corrects as users study the 8 new questions

9. **Build check**: `npm run build` completes without errors

  <resume-signal>Type "approved" to confirm all checks pass, or describe any issues found</resume-signal>
