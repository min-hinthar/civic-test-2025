## What was built

Fixed ROADMAP "12 providers" typo and added requirements-completed field to all 18 SUMMARY frontmatters.

### Key changes

1. **ROADMAP typo fix** — Phase 40 SC-2 corrected from "12 context providers" to "10 context providers" (matching actual ClientProviders.tsx)
2. **18 SUMMARY frontmatter updates** — Added `requirements-completed: [REQ-ID, ...]` field to all SUMMARY.md files across phases 39-43, mapping each plan to the requirement IDs it helped satisfy

### Key files

- `.planning/ROADMAP.md` — corrected provider count
- 18 SUMMARY.md files across phases 39-43 — requirements-completed field added

## Deviations
