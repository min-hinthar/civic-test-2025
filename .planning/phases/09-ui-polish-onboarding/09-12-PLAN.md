Purpose: Final polish pass ensures every page has consistent Duolingo feel and all locked audit checklist items are satisfied.
Output: Refreshed HistoryPage, SocialHubPage, InterviewPage, plus comprehensive cross-page audit fixes.

  <how-to-verify>
1. Run `npm run build` and verify it completes without errors
2. Open http://localhost:3000 and check:
   a. Landing page: bilingual hero, feature cards, patriotic motif, 3D CTA button
   b. Auth page: Duolingo-inspired design, patriotic motif
   c. Dashboard: hero readiness score, reorganized cards, bottom tab bar on mobile
   d. Test page: horizontal progress bar, 3D answer buttons, correct/incorrect icon reactions + sounds
   e. Study guide: category color header strips on flashcards
   f. Progress page: vertical skill tree with 7 nodes, medal rings
   g. History page: visual refresh with rounded cards
   h. Social hub: collaborative feel, no competitive shame
   i. Settings: grouped sections with icons, sound toggle, replay tour button
3. Test onboarding: clear localStorage key `civic-test-onboarding-complete`, refresh dashboard -> should see welcome screen then 7-step tour
4. Test sound: ensure sounds play for correct/incorrect (if unmuted)
5. Test dark mode: all pages should have equally vibrant styling
6. Test mobile (375px): bottom tab bar visible, all pages responsive
7. Test sync indicator: simulate offline (DevTools Network tab) -> take test -> see floating indicator
8. Verify: no red error colors on non-data-loss scenarios
