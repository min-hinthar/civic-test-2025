# v3.0 World-Class UX — Milestone Audit Report

**Milestone:** v3.0 World-Class UX
**Audited:** 2026-02-22 (re-audit after gap closure phases 35–38)
**Previous Audit:** 2026-02-20 (identified 3 integration gaps — all now closed)
**Status:** tech_debt (all requirements met, no critical blockers, accumulated deferred items)
**Score:** 39/39 requirements satisfied

## Executive Summary

All 39 requirements across 10 phases are **substantively satisfied** with verified code evidence. The three integration gaps found in the 2026-02-20 audit have been **closed by gap closure phases 35 and 36**:

1. ~~Phase 34 touch targets below 44px~~ → **Fixed in Phase 35** (min-h-[44px] on all 3 elements)
2. ~~Mock Test missing Phase 32 choreography~~ → **Fixed in Phase 36** (shared TestResultsScreen mode="mock-test")
3. ~~REQUIREMENTS.md checkboxes stale~~ → **Fixed in Phase 35** (all VISC-01–07 now [x])

Two new integration items found by the cross-phase checker:
1. DotLottie animation assets absent from `public/lottie/` (cosmetic — graceful degradation)
2. Screen reader announce() missing under reduced-motion celebration path (low impact)

Neither is a blocker. The milestone delivers on its definition of done.

## Cross-Phase Integration Report

### E2E Flow Verification: 7.5/8 complete

| # | Flow | Status | Details |
|---|------|--------|---------|
| 1 | New user (Landing → Auth → Dashboard → Study → Practice → Results → Dashboard) | COMPLETE | Empty state → skeleton → full render; CategoryChipRow, FlashcardToolbar wired |
| 2 | Returning user (Dashboard → SRS → Flashcard → Practice → Results) | COMPLETE | Auto-play, bookmark, choreography all wired |
| 3 | Mock test (Dashboard → Test → Timer → Results → Review) | COMPLETE | Shared TestResultsScreen mode="mock-test" (Phase 36 fix) |
| 4 | Interview (Dashboard → Interview → Self-grade → Transcript → Results) | COMPLETE | Practice/Realistic mode branching correct |
| 5 | About page (4 entry points) | COMPLETE | Landing heart, Settings, BottomTabBar heart, Sidebar heart |
| 6 | Offline (OfflineBanner → Queue → Sync with withRetry) | COMPLETE | 14 withRetry call sites in production sync code |
| 7 | Celebration (useCelebration → CelebrationOverlay → multi-sensory) | PARTIAL | Normal motion: complete. Reduced-motion: announce() gap |
| 8 | Accessibility (reduced motion, focus mgmt, screen reader) | MOSTLY COMPLETE | Focus management + modal traps work; reduced-motion celebrate announce gap |

### Integration Issues Found

**Issue 1 — Medium: DotLottie assets absent (CELB-06)**
- `public/lottie/` directory is empty — `checkmark.lottie`, `trophy.lottie` never render
- Code gracefully degrades (Suspense fallback={null}, no crash)
- Documented in Phase 32 as "animation files not yet sourced"
- **Impact:** Visual-only — confetti + sound + haptics still fire

**Issue 2 — Low: Reduced-motion screen reader gap (STAT-06)**
- `CelebrationOverlay` mounts `ReducedMotionTimer` instead of `Confetti` under `prefers-reduced-motion`
- `announce('Celebration!')` is in `Confetti.tsx` — never fires when Confetti isn't mounted
- `BadgeCelebration` and `MasteryMilestone` have independent `announce()` calls (work correctly)
- **Impact:** Test-pass celebrations under reduced-motion don't announce to screen readers

### Previous Audit Gaps — All Closed

| Previous Gap | Closed By | Status |
|-------------|-----------|--------|
| VISC-04: Phase 34 touch targets below 44px (3 elements) | Phase 35: min-h-[44px] on GlassHeader heart, AboutPage Share, external links | CLOSED |
