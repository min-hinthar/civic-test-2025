Settings requirements (locked):
- Rounded cards, icons, grouped sections
- Duolingo visual treatment
</instructions>

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Dashboard Overhaul with Hero Readiness Score</name>
  <files>src/pages/Dashboard.tsx</files>
  <action>
Reorganize Dashboard layout with Duolingo-inspired game home screen feel:

**Hero Section (top of page):**
- ReadinessIndicator as the HERO element -- large, prominent, centered at top
- Make it visually dominant: larger font, gradient background card, patriotic emoji accents
- Include a motivational bilingual message based on readiness level (e.g., "Almost there!" if 70%+, "Keep going!" if <50%)
- Patriotic eagle emoji next to readiness score for encouragement

**Quick Actions Row:**
- Horizontal row of 2-3 3D chunky buttons below hero:
  - "Start Test" (primary), "Study Cards" (secondary), "Interview" (accent)
- Each with icon + bilingual label
- Full-width on mobile, inline on desktop

**Card Hierarchy (redesigned layout):**
Arrange dashboard widgets in order of importance:
1. **SRS Widget** (due cards) - prominent if cards are due, with `data-tour="srs-deck"` attribute
2. **Streak Widget** - current streak with encouraging message
3. **Interview Widget** - recent performance, with `data-tour="interview-sim"` attribute
4. **Category Grid** - mastery overview per category

Each card:
- Rounded-2xl (20px per plan 01)
- Intense gradient shadow (from plan 01 Card component)
- Bold section headers (font-bold or font-extrabold)
- Contextual patriotic emojis (eagle for achievements, flag for milestones, star for progress)
- Stagger entrance animation using motion/react

**Grid Layout:**
- Mobile: single column stack
- Tablet: 2-column grid
- Desktop: 2-3 column grid with hero spanning full width

**Ensure data-tour attributes preserved:**
- `data-tour="dashboard"` on main content area
- `data-tour="srs-deck"` on SRS widget wrapper
- `data-tour="interview-sim"` on Interview widget wrapper

**Typography:**
- Page title: font-extrabold, text-3xl
- Section headers: font-bold, text-xl
- All with bilingual support where appropriate

**Empty states:**
- If no test history: encouraging bilingual message with eagle emoji + "Take your first test!" CTA
- If no SRS cards: "Add cards to your deck" prompt with star emoji
  </action>
  <verify>Run `npx tsc --noEmit`. Verify ReadinessIndicator is the first major element rendered. Verify data-tour attributes are present for dashboard, srs-deck, and interview-sim.</verify>
  <done>Dashboard has hero readiness score, reorganized card hierarchy, 3D buttons, patriotic emojis, responsive grid, and stagger animations.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Settings Page Duolingo Visual Treatment</name>
  <files>src/pages/SettingsPage.tsx</files>
  <action>
Apply Duolingo visual treatment to SettingsPage:

**Grouped Sections with Icons:**
Organize settings into clear groups, each in a rounded-2xl card:

1. **Account** section (User icon):
   - User info display
   - Sign out button

2. **Appearance** section (Palette or Sun/Moon icon):
   - Theme toggle (existing)
   - Language toggle (existing)

3. **Sound & Notifications** section (Bell icon):
   - Sound effects toggle (added in plan 02)
   - Push notification settings (existing)
   - SRS review reminder (existing)

4. **Social** section (Users icon):
   - Social settings (existing from Phase 7)

5. **Help** section (HelpCircle icon):
   - Replay onboarding tour button (added in plan 04)
   - App version info

6. **Danger Zone** section (AlertTriangle icon):
   - Clear history (uses destructive/warm red -- data loss scenario)
   - Sign out

Each section:
- Rounded-2xl card with subtle shadow
- Section header with icon + bold bilingual title
- Items separated by thin border-b dividers
- Toggle switches for boolean settings
- 44px minimum touch target on all interactive elements
- Dark mode: same card styling, equally vibrant

**Layout:**
- Single column on mobile, max-w-2xl centered on desktop
- Page title: font-extrabold with settings icon
- Bilingual page title

**Interactions:**
- Subtle hover states on interactive items
- Spring animation on toggle switches
  </action>
  <verify>Run `npx tsc --noEmit`. Verify settings are organized in grouped card sections. Verify all Burmese text has font-myanmar class. Verify 44px touch targets on interactive elements.</verify>
  <done>Settings page has Duolingo visual treatment with grouped sections, icons, rounded cards, proper typography, and responsive layout.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- `npx tsc --noEmit` passes
- `npm run lint` passes
- Dashboard ReadinessIndicator is the first major component
- Dashboard has data-tour attributes for srs-deck and interview-sim
- Settings has grouped card sections with icons
- Both pages responsive at 375px, 768px, 1024px+
