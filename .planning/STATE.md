## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md

## Position

**Milestone:** v3.0 World-Class UX
**Current phase:** 37-bug-fixes-ux-polish
**Current Plan:** 5 of 7 in Phase
**Status:** In Progress

## Accumulated Context

### Roadmap Evolution
- Phase 37 added: Bug Fixes & UX Polish (Study Guide, Flashcards, Review Deck, Mock Test, Interview fixes + About navbar link)

### Decisions
- 37-03: Local-only persistence (no Supabase sync) for bookmark simplicity
- 37-03: Dedicated IndexedDB store matching srsStore pattern
- 37-03: Simple hook pattern (no Context provider) since bookmark state is component-local
- 37-02: Heart icon placed between language toggle and theme toggle in both nav surfaces
- 37-02: Used fill-current class for filled heart active state instead of separate filled icon
- 37-02: CSS-based float+shimmer for About card instead of JS-only animation for performance

| Phase-Plan | Duration | Tasks | Files |
|-----------|----------|-------|-------|
| 37-03 | 5min | 1 | 3 |
| 37-02 | 5min | 2 | 5 |
