<objective>
Verify the complete Phase 16 implementation through automated build/test checks and a visual/functional checkpoint.

Purpose: Ensure all 5 DASH requirements are met and the dashboard transformation is correct before marking Phase 16 complete.

Output: Verification report confirming all requirements pass.

  <name>Task 1: Automated build and test verification</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Run automated verification checks:

1. **TypeScript compilation**: `npx tsc --noEmit`
   - Expected: zero errors

2. **Unit tests**: `npx vitest run src/lib/nba/`
   - Expected: all NBA determination tests pass

3. **Full test suite**: `npx vitest run`
   - Expected: all existing tests still pass (no regressions)

4. **Production build**: `npm run build`
   - Expected: builds successfully with no errors

5. **File size check**: Verify Dashboard.tsx line count is under 250 lines
   - `wc -l src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`

6. **Import verification**: Check that NBAHeroCard, CompactStatRow, CategoryPreviewCard, RecentActivityCard are all imported in Dashboard.tsx

7. **Removed section verification**: Verify these strings/components are NOT in Dashboard.tsx:
   - ReadinessIndicator
   - SRSWidget
   - StreakWidget
   - InterviewDashboardWidget
   - BadgeHighlights
   - LeaderboardWidget
   - CategoryGrid
   - SuggestedFocus
   - "Quick Action" (comment or component name)

8. **Requirement check**:
   - DASH-01: NBAHeroCard imported and rendered in Dashboard.tsx
   - DASH-02: determineNBA.test.ts has tests for all 8 states
   - DASH-03: nbaStrings.ts contains bilingual content (search for Myanmar Unicode characters)
   - DASH-04: CompactStatRow imported and rendered in Dashboard.tsx
   - DASH-05: CategoryPreviewCard and RecentActivityCard imported and rendered in Dashboard.tsx

Write results to `.planning/phases/16-dashboard-next-best-action/16-05-verification-report.md` in a table format showing each check, expected result, actual result, and pass/fail status.

  <verify>All 8 automated checks pass</verify>

  <what-built>
Complete dashboard transformation from 16-section wall to focused NBA layout:
- NBA hero card with contextual recommendation, bilingual text, gradient, animations
- Compact stat row with 4 metrics (streak, mastery, SRS due, practiced)
- Category preview showing top 3 weak categories
- Recent activity showing last test sessions
- All old redundant sections removed
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open http://localhost:3000 in browser
3. Verify dashboard shows:
   - [ ] NBA hero card is the dominant element (full-width, glassmorphic, with gradient)
   - [ ] Card shows contextual recommendation based on your current state
   - [ ] Bilingual text visible (toggle Burmese in Settings if needed)
   - [ ] Primary CTA button and secondary skip link present
   - [ ] 4 compact stat cards below NBA card (streak, mastery %, SRS due, practiced)
   - [ ] Stat numbers animate up on page load
   - [ ] Category preview card shows top weak categories
   - [ ] Recent activity card shows test sessions
   - [ ] Preview cards are tappable to Hub
   - [ ] No old sections visible (no Quick Actions, no ReadinessIndicator, no SRS Widget, etc.)
4. Test responsiveness:
   - [ ] Desktop: preview cards side by side
   - [ ] Mobile (resize browser): preview cards stacked, stat row 2x2 grid
5. Test NBA state changes (if applicable):
   - [ ] Navigate to /study#review and complete a review, then return -- recommendation may change
6. Verify celebrations still work (if you have badges/milestones queued)
