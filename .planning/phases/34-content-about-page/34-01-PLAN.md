<objective>
Create the bilingual content data layer for the About page and verify CONT-01/CONT-02 explanation completeness.

Purpose: All narrative text, dedication card content, and external links must exist as structured typed constants before the UI components can consume them. CONT-01 and CONT-02 are already satisfied by prior work — this plan verifies that status.
Output: `src/constants/about/aboutContent.ts` with full bilingual content; verification that all 128 questions have explanations.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Verify CONT-01 and CONT-02 explanation completeness</name>
  <files>read-only verification of src/constants/questions/*.ts</files>
  <action>
Verify that all 128 USCIS questions (including the 28 USCIS 2025 additions) have explanation objects. Run a grep or script to confirm every question has `explanation:` with `brief_en`, `brief_my`, and `citation` fields.

Per the CONTEXT.md locked decision: "All 128 USCIS questions already have full explanation objects." This task simply confirms that claim. If any gaps are discovered, fill them matching the existing format and depth — but gaps are not expected.

Expected result: 128/128 questions confirmed with explanations. Log the verification result.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run: `grep -r "explanation:" src/constants/questions/ | wc -l` and confirm count is >= 128.
Run: `grep -r "brief_en:" src/constants/questions/ | wc -l` and confirm count is >= 128.
  </verify>
  <done>All 128 questions have explanation objects with brief_en, brief_my, and citation fields confirmed.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create bilingual About page content constants</name>
  <files>src/constants/about/aboutContent.ts</files>
  <action>
Create `src/constants/about/aboutContent.ts` exporting a typed `aboutContent` constant. Import `BilingualString` from `@/lib/i18n/strings`.

**Content structure (Claude's Discretion on section flow):**

Define TypeScript interfaces:
```typescript
interface DedicationPerson {
  name: BilingualString;
  role: BilingualString;
  briefTribute: BilingualString;
  fullTribute: BilingualString;
}

interface AboutSection {
  title: BilingualString;
  paragraphs: BilingualString[];
}

interface ExternalLink {
  label: BilingualString;
  url: string;
}

interface AboutContent {
  hero: {
    title: BilingualString;
    subtitle: BilingualString;
  };
  sections: AboutSection[];  // narrative sections (origin, mission, VIA, PCP)
  dedications: {
    sectionTitle: BilingualString;
    dwightClark: DedicationPerson;
    guyots: DedicationPerson;
  };
  callToAction: {
    title: BilingualString;
    message: BilingualString;
  };
  externalLinks: ExternalLink[];
  footer: {
    version: string;
    year: number;
    repoUrl: string;
    openSourceNotice: BilingualString;
  };
}
```

**Narrative content requirements (from CONTEXT.md locked decisions):**
- **Tone:** Personal storytelling, warm, first-person or close narrative voice ("This app was born from...")
- **Emotional weight:** Heartfelt and moving — the reader should feel something
- **Burmese framing:** Burmese-anchored, broader welcome — born from the Burmese community experience, but welcoming to anyone
- **No tech details** — focus purely on mission, people, and impact
- **Page length:** Medium read (3-4 scrolls) — 4-5 narrative sections

**Narrative sections to include (Claude's Discretion on ordering and flow):**
1. Origin story — how this app came to be, connection to the Burmese immigrant community
2. Mission — helping people pass the civics test with dignity and confidence
3. VIA (Volunteers in Asia) — Dwight Clark's 1963 founding at Stanford, 40 years sending volunteers to Asia, the two-way exchange philosophy, the Burma/Myanmar connection
4. Pre-Collegiate Program — Dorothy & Jim Guyot and Sayar-Gyi Khin Maung Win founding PCP in 2003, liberal arts curriculum in Yangon, 80+ Myanmar students on full-ride scholarships abroad
5. Call to action — share the app with community members who might benefit

**Dedication card content (from RESEARCH.md biographical data):**

**Dwight D. Clark card:**
- Name: "Dwight D. Clark" / Burmese transliteration
- Role: Founder of VIA and Learning Across Borders
- Brief tribute: 1-2 sentences about founding VIA in 1963 and dedicating 40 years to connecting Americans and Asians
- Full tribute: 3-4 sentences expanding on the Stanford origin, the two-way exchange philosophy, Burma study tours, and Learning Across Borders

**Dorothy & James Guyot card (shared, with Sayar-Gyi Khin Maung Win):**
- Name: "Dorothy & James Guyot" / Burmese transliteration
- Role: Co-founders of Pre-Collegiate Program, Yangon (with Sayar-Gyi Khin Maung Win)
- Brief tribute: 1-2 sentences about their deep connection to Burma and founding PCP
- Full tribute: 3-4 sentences about their Yale backgrounds, 18 months living in Burma in 1961, founding PCP in 2003 with Prof. Dr. U Khin Maung Win, and the 80+ students who gained college admissions on full scholarships
- CRITICAL: Preserve "Sayar-Gyi" honorific in both English and Burmese text

**External links (2-3 stable resources):**
- USCIS.gov civics test page
- VIA Programs website (viaprograms.org)

**Footer:**
- version: "3.0", year: 2026
- repoUrl: "https://github.com/min-hinthar/civic-test-2025"
- Open source notice in both languages

**Burmese text guidelines:**
- Keep Burmese simple and direct rather than attempting literary flourish
- Use proper Myanmar script (not transliterations)
- Apply `font-myanmar` class in the components that render this content (not here — this is data only)
- Flag that Burmese narrative text may need native speaker review per known issue BRMSE-01

Run: `npx tsc --noEmit` — no TypeScript errors.
Verify the file exports `aboutContent` and all required sections are present.
Verify BilingualString import resolves correctly.
  </verify>
  <done>aboutContent.ts exports a fully typed constant with hero, narrative sections, dedications (Clark + Guyots with Khin Maung Win), call to action, external links, and footer — all in both English and Burmese.</done>
