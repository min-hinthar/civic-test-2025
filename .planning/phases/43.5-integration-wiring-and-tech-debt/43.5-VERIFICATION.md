# Phase 43.5: Integration Wiring and Tech Debt — Verification

## Goal
All cross-phase integration gaps are closed and tech debt from the v4.0 audit is resolved.

## Success Criteria Verification

### SC-1: PracticePage reads ?category=X search param and pre-selects matching category
**Status**: PASSED
- `src/views/PracticePage.tsx` imports `useSearchParams` from `next/navigation` (line 4)
- Reads `searchParams.get('category')` and validates against `USCIS_CATEGORY_NAMES` and `SUB_CATEGORY_NAMES` (lines 46-53)
- Passes `initialCategory` prop to `PracticeConfig` (line 269)
- `app/(protected)/practice/page.tsx` wraps in `<Suspense>` boundary (required for useSearchParams)

### SC-2: GoogleOneTapSignIn fallback redirect targets /home directly
**Status**: PASSED
- `src/components/GoogleOneTapSignIn.tsx` line 76: `redirectTo: \`${window.location.origin}/home\``
- No redirect hop through /dashboard

### SC-3: ROADMAP Phase 40 description corrected from "12 providers" to "10 providers"
**Status**: PASSED
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md` line 114: "wraps all 10 context providers"

### SC-4: Phase SUMMARY frontmatters include requirements-completed field
**Status**: PASSED
- 18 unique SUMMARY.md files across phases 39-43 have `requirements-completed` field
- Values verified against VERIFICATION.md cross-reference data from v4.0 milestone audit

## Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| RDNS-04 (adjacent) | Quality improvement | Practice ?category= wiring connects drill results to practice config |
| RDNS-05 (adjacent) | Quality improvement | Practice ?category= wiring enables sub-category pre-selection |
| MIGR-12 (adjacent) | Quality improvement | GoogleOneTapSignIn redirect fix, ROADMAP typo fix, SUMMARY traceability |

## Score: 4/4 must-haves verified

## Commits
- `d8ede9c` feat(43.5-01): wire practice ?category= pre-selection and fix Google redirect
- `d75dfad` docs(43.5-02): fix ROADMAP provider count and add requirements traceability
