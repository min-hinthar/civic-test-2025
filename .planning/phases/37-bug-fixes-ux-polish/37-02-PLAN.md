<objective>
Add About page link to navbar (between language toggle and theme toggle) with Heart icon that transitions from outline to filled when active, and elevate the landing page About teaser card with persistent subtle animation.

Purpose: User decision locks About link in navbar and improved landing card prominence.
Output: Updated nav components + enhanced landing page card.

  <name>Task 1: Add About Heart icon to navbar + remove from HIDDEN_ROUTES</name>
  <files>src/components/navigation/navConfig.ts, src/components/navigation/BottomTabBar.tsx, src/components/navigation/Sidebar.tsx</files>
  <action>
**Step 1: Remove /about from HIDDEN_ROUTES in navConfig.ts**

In `navConfig.ts` line 122-129, remove `'/about'` from the `HIDDEN_ROUTES` array so that Sidebar and BottomTabBar render on the About page. This lets users navigate away from About using the standard nav.

**Step 2: Add About utility icon to BottomTabBar.tsx**

The About link is NOT a tab — it's a utility control positioned between the language toggle (FlagToggle) and theme toggle. Look at how BottomTabBar renders its utility controls section and insert the About Heart icon between them.

- Import `Heart` from `lucide-react` (outline version)
- Import `useLocation` from `react-router-dom` to detect active state
- Detect if current route is `/about`: `const isAboutActive = location.pathname === '/about' || location.hash === '#/about'`
- Render a button with `min-h-[44px] min-w-[44px]` touch target
- When active: use `text-primary` color and filled heart appearance (use `fill-current` class to make Heart filled)
- When inactive: use `text-muted-foreground` with standard outline Heart
- On click: `navigate('/about')` using react-router-dom
- Add `aria-label="About"` and `aria-current={isAboutActive ? 'page' : undefined}`
- Add spring `whileTap={{ scale: 0.92 }}` micro-interaction via motion.button
- Tooltip on hover (desktop): "About" text

**Step 3: Add About utility icon to Sidebar.tsx**

Mirror the same Heart icon in the desktop Sidebar utility controls section, between language toggle and theme toggle. Follow the same pattern as BottomTabBar: outline Heart normally, filled/primary when on About page. Use the sidebar's existing utility control layout pattern (icon-only when collapsed, label visible when expanded).

Respect the existing Sidebar collapsed vs expanded states:
- Collapsed: Show only Heart icon
- Expanded: Show Heart icon + "About" label text
  </action>
  <verify>Run `npm run typecheck`. Navigate to /#/about — nav should still be visible (not hidden). Heart icon should be visible in both mobile bottom bar and desktop sidebar. Heart should be primary-colored when on About page, muted when elsewhere.</verify>
  <done>Heart icon appears in both BottomTabBar and Sidebar utility controls, between language and theme toggles. About page shows navigation. Icon transitions between outline/filled based on active route.</done>

  <name>Task 2: Enhance landing page About teaser card with persistent animation</name>
  <files>src/pages/LandingPage.tsx, src/styles/animations.css</files>
  <action>
**Step 1: Add CSS class for About card animation**

In `animations.css`, add:
```css
/* About card persistent animation - combines subtle float + shimmer */
.about-card-animated {
  animation: floaty 6s ease-in-out infinite;
  position: relative;
}

.about-card-animated::after {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  border-radius: inherit;
  background: linear-gradient(
    90deg,
    transparent 0%,
    hsl(var(--color-primary) / 0.06) 50%,
    transparent 100%
  );
  background-size: 200% 100%;
  animation: shimmer 4s infinite;
  pointer-events: none;
}

@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .about-card-animated {
    animation: none;
  }
  .about-card-animated::after {
    animation: none;
  }
}
```

Check that `@keyframes floaty` and `@keyframes shimmer` already exist in globals.css or animations.css — they should from prior phases. If `floaty` doesn't exist, use a simple transform-based float:
```css
@keyframes floaty {
  0%, 100% { transform: translateY(0); }
  50% { transform: translateY(-6px); }
}
```

**Step 2: Enhance the landing page About card**

In `LandingPage.tsx` lines 307-347, upgrade the About teaser section:

1. Add `about-card-animated` class to the card container div (the one with `rounded-2xl border border-border/60 bg-card`).

2. Make the card more prominent:
   - Increase padding from `p-6` to `p-8`
   - Add a subtle gradient border: `border-primary/20` instead of `border-border/60`
   - Increase shadow: `shadow-lg shadow-primary/10` instead of `shadow-md`
   - Add `overflow-hidden` to contain the shimmer pseudo-element

3. Animate the Heart icon with a gentle pulse using motion/react:
   ```tsx
   <motion.div
     animate={{ scale: [1, 1.1, 1] }}
     transition={{ duration: 2, repeat: Infinity, ease: 'easeInOut' }}
   >
     <Heart className="h-10 w-10 text-primary" />
   </motion.div>
   ```
   Wrap in a reduced-motion check — skip animation when `shouldReduceMotion` is true.

4. Increase heading size from `text-lg` to `text-xl` for more prominence.

Note: Use CSS custom properties for all colors (no hex values — stylelint enforces this).
  </action>
  <verify>Run `npm run typecheck` and `npm run lint:css`. View landing page — About card should float subtly with shimmer effect. Heart icon should pulse gently. Card should be more visually prominent than surrounding content. Verify reduced-motion media query disables animations.</verify>
  <done>Landing page About card has persistent float+shimmer animation, pulsing Heart icon, increased prominence with gradient border and larger shadow. Reduced motion fallback disables all animations.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. `npm run typecheck` passes
2. `npm run lint:css` passes
3. BottomTabBar and Sidebar show Heart icon for About
4. Heart icon is filled/primary when on About page
5. About page shows standard navigation (not hidden)
6. Landing page About card has visible persistent animation
7. Reduced motion disables all new animations
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- About link in navbar between language and theme toggles on both surfaces
- Active state shows filled Heart with primary color
- Landing page About card floats/shimmers persistently
- All animations respect prefers-reduced-motion
- No lint or type errors
</success_criteria>
