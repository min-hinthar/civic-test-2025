<objective>
Improve Burmese translations for all 47 American Government questions — the largest and highest-priority question file.

Purpose: American Government contains nearly half of all civics questions. These are the most commonly tested and most important for users to understand in their native language.

Output: Updated `american-government.ts` with natural Burmese translations + cross-check file for AI verification.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Improve Burmese translations in american-government.ts</name>
  <files>src/constants/questions/american-government.ts</files>
  <action>
Review and improve ALL Burmese translation fields in `american-government.ts` (47 questions). For each question, check and update:

- `question_my` — the question text in Burmese
- `studyAnswers[].text_my` — each study answer in Burmese
- `answers[].text_my` — each multiple-choice answer in Burmese
- `explanation.brief_my` — the explanation in Burmese (light pass only per user decision — fix obvious issues but don't rewrite)

**Translation standards (from glossary):**
1. **Register:** Casual conversational — how you'd talk to a friend. Use informal pronouns and colloquial phrasing. Avoid formal/literary register.
2. **Proper nouns:** Burmese transliteration + (English) — e.g., ဂျော့ချ် ဝါရှင်တန် (George Washington)
3. **Civics terms:** Burmese translation + (English) for key terms — e.g., ဖွဲ့စည်းပုံအခြေခံဥပဒေ (Constitution)
4. **Numbers:** Myanmar numerals (၀-၉) in narrative text, Arabic numerals for technical/counting
5. **Ordinals:** Burmese ordinal pattern — ပထမ ပြင်ဆင်ချက် (First Amendment)
6. **Plurals:** Burmese classifier pattern — မေးခွန်း ၅ ခု (5 questions)
7. **Use literal Myanmar characters** (not Unicode escapes like `\u1000`) for readability

**What to look for:**
- Robotic/formal phrasing → rewrite as casual conversational
- Missing English terms in parentheses for key civics concepts
- Inconsistent terminology (use glossary as reference)
- Incorrect or awkward particles (subject/object markers)
- Stiff question endings → use natural ဘာလဲ, ဘယ်သူလဲ, ဘာကြောင့်လဲ patterns

**Important:** Use literal Myanmar characters throughout. Do NOT use Unicode escape sequences.

Add a TSDoc marker at the top of the file:
```typescript
/** @verified claude-initial-pass 2026-02-XX — pending 3-AI consensus */
```
  </action>
  <verify>File compiles: `npx tsc --noEmit src/constants/questions/american-government.ts` or `npm run typecheck` passes. All 47 questions still have `question_my`, `studyAnswers[].text_my`, `answers[].text_my` fields populated.</verify>
  <done>All 47 American Government questions have natural, conversational Burmese translations using consistent terminology from the glossary.</done>

  <name>Task 2: Generate cross-check file for American Government questions</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/25-burmese-translation-audit/cross-check-wave-1a.md</files>
  <action>
Create a cross-check file at `.planning/phases/25-burmese-translation-audit/cross-check-wave-1a.md` containing a markdown table of all changed Burmese translations from Task 1.

Format:
```markdown
# Wave 1a: American Government Questions - Cross-Check

Instructions: Copy each table section to Gemini and GPT independently. Ask each to verify the Burmese column for accuracy, naturalness, and consistency. Report back any strings where all 3 AIs disagree.

## Questions (question_my)

| ID | English | Proposed Burmese |
|----|---------|-----------------|
| GOV-P01 | What is the supreme law of the land? | [proposed translation] |
| ... | ... | ... |

## Study Answers (text_my)

| ID | English | Proposed Burmese |
|----|---------|-----------------|
| GOV-P01-a1 | the Constitution | [proposed translation] |
| ... | ... | ... |
```

Include ONLY strings that were actually changed from their original values. If a translation was already good and left unchanged, omit it from the cross-check file.

Group by: questions first, then study answers, then multiple-choice answers, then explanations.
  </action>
  <verify>Cross-check file exists. Each row has an ID, English text, and proposed Burmese text. Table is valid markdown.</verify>
  <done>Cross-check file contains all changed American Government translations in a format ready for Gemini/GPT verification.</done>
