## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Native mobile app (Capacitor/RN) | PWA is sufficient |
| Real-time chat | High complexity, not core to test prep |
| Video content | Storage/bandwidth costs, unnecessary for civics format |
| AI chatbot tutor | Expensive API costs, risk of incorrect answers |
| Paid/premium tier | App stays free for immigrants |
| Full voice input recognition | Complex, privacy concerns |
| AI-generated questions | Legal test prep must use only official USCIS content |
| Full Liquid Glass component library | Immature libraries, bundle size, browser compat issues |
| Burmese translation crowd-editing | Quality control nightmare, vandalism risk |
| Supporting both 2008 and 2025 tests | 2008 test audience is diminishing |
| Hamburger menu / sidebar drawer | Hides navigation, bad for target audience |
