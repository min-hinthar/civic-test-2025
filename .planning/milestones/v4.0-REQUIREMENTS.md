# Requirements: Civic Test Prep 2025

**Defined:** 2026-02-23
**Core Value:** Burmese immigrants can confidently prepare for and pass the US civics test using an app that feels welcoming and speaks their language.

## v4.0 Requirements

Requirements for v4.0 Next-Gen Architecture. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Migration

- [x] **MIGR-01**: App builds and runs on Next.js 16 with Turbopack/webpack compatibility
- [x] **MIGR-02**: `middleware.ts` renamed to `proxy.ts` with updated export
- [x] **MIGR-03**: Sentry reconfigured for App Router (`instrumentation.ts`, `global-error.tsx`)
- [x] **MIGR-04**: App Router root layout with Server Component shell and ClientProviders wrapper
- [x] **MIGR-05**: All 15+ routes migrated from react-router-dom to Next.js file-based routing
- [x] **MIGR-06**: `react-router-dom` removed from package.json
- [x] **MIGR-07**: Auth guard implemented via `(protected)/layout.tsx` route group
- [x] **MIGR-08**: Page transitions work with App Router using `template.tsx` pattern
- [x] **MIGR-09**: CSP upgraded from hash-based to nonce-based using proxy nonce injection
- [x] **MIGR-10**: Service worker updated for App Router asset paths
- [x] **MIGR-11**: All API routes migrated to Route Handlers (`app/api/*/route.ts`)
- [x] **MIGR-12**: Clean URLs work without hash prefix (no more `#/dashboard`)

### Readiness

- [x] **RDNS-01**: User can see a test readiness score (0-100%) on Dashboard
- [x] **RDNS-02**: Readiness score shows per-dimension breakdown (accuracy, coverage, consistency)
- [x] **RDNS-03**: Readiness formula penalizes zero-coverage categories and projects FSRS retrievability
- [x] **RDNS-04**: User can start a dedicated weak-area drill from Dashboard
- [x] **RDNS-05**: Category-level drill buttons appear on categories below mastery threshold
- [x] **RDNS-06**: Drill session shows pre/post mastery improvement delta
- [x] **RDNS-07**: User can set test date in Settings
- [x] **RDNS-08**: Countdown display shows days remaining on Dashboard and Progress Hub
- [x] **RDNS-09**: Daily study targets card on Dashboard (SRS review + new questions + mock test recommendation)
- [x] **RDNS-10**: Daily targets adapt dynamically when user misses or studies ahead

### Content

- [x] **CONT-01**: All 128 questions have mnemonic fields populated (English)
- [x] **CONT-02**: All 128 questions have fun fact fields populated (English + Burmese)
- [x] **CONT-03**: All 128 questions have common mistake fields populated (English + Burmese)
- [x] **CONT-04**: All 128 questions have citation fields populated
- [x] **CONT-05**: Mnemonics display with distinct visual treatment (lightbulb icon, accent border)
- [x] **CONT-06**: 7 category study tips shown as dismissible cards in category practice
- [x] **CONT-07**: "Tricky Questions" difficulty badges on hard questions
- [x] **CONT-08**: "See Also" related question chips rendered in study/review contexts

### Cross-Device Sync

- [x] **SYNC-01**: Answer history (mastery data) syncs to Supabase for cross-device continuity
- [x] **SYNC-02**: Bookmarks sync to Supabase across devices
- [x] **SYNC-03**: User settings (theme, language, voice, test date) sync to Supabase
- [x] **SYNC-04**: Study streak data syncs to Supabase for accurate cross-device tracking

### Performance

- [x] **PERF-01**: Heavy components (recharts, DotLottie, confetti) use dynamic imports
- [x] **PERF-02**: `optimizePackageImports` configured for date-fns and recharts
- [x] **PERF-03**: Bundle size documented with before/after comparison
- [x] **PERF-04**: Web Vitals verified against v3.0 baseline (no regressions)

## Future Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Content Quality

- **BRMSE-01**: Burmese mnemonic content reviewed by native Myanmar speaker (carried from v2.1)
- **CONT-09**: Burmese mnemonics authored using language-appropriate mnemonic devices
- **CONT-10**: Video explanations for complex topics

### Advanced Features

- **ADVN-01**: AI-powered adaptive study recommendations
- **ADVN-02**: Calendar-based scheduling UI with spaced repetition integration
- **ADVN-03**: Predictive pass probability based on psychometric modeling
- **ADVN-04**: User-generated mnemonics with moderation

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Incremental route migration | Mixed Pages/App Router causes hard navigations that destroy provider state |
| AnimatePresence exit animations | Unsupported in App Router (accepted regression); revisit with ViewTransition API |
| Full Turbopack migration | Webpack plugin chain (Sentry + Serwist) incompatible; use `--webpack` flag |
| Server-side rendering | App requires browser APIs (IndexedDB, SpeechSynthesis); stays client-rendered |
| Calendar scheduling UI | Over-engineering for 128-question single-subject test |
| AI chatbot tutor | API cost, offline incompatibility, hallucination risk for consequential test |
| Swipe between tabs | Gesture conflicts with existing SwipeableCard |
| Character mascot | Asset burden, scope creep |
